# recipe-sharing-app
This page was built using following stack technologies:
  1. Node.js with Express framework
  2. MongoDB with its native drive for nodejs
  3. React as a frontend framework (even though react is a library:-))
  4. Scss for CSS preprosessor
  
  
  
P.S.
  Design at this stage is limited by the my knowledge, and I will gladly accept any suggestions for that.
  This project was done as a part of #100DaysOfCode challange on days 73-76 total time spent: around 5 hours
